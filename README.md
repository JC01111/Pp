Hi~
These are the projects I completed, 
due to some technical issues I compressed some files, you would have to download it. (Click on the file and press raw to download).

For Game2048, you can simply run it on Intellij 

For Ngordnet you would be using browser to find 

For BYOW, it's an open world demo game, I am still working on it to make it to a game

(Dont' forget to download the library for java programs)

Scheme Project is written in Python, I used python to replicate the basic logics of how does scheme work (eval, operator, function, etc).
